The story of humanity begins millions of years ago with our early ancestors, part of the hominin lineage that split from the common ancestor shared with chimpanzees around 6–7 million years ago in Africa. One of the earliest known hominins is Sahelanthropus tchadensis, dating back about 7 million years. Over time, other species appeared, such as Australopithecus afarensis—famous for the skeleton "Lucy"—which lived roughly 3.9 to 2.9 million years ago and showed clear signs of bipedalism, an important step toward modern human traits. 
Around 2.4 million years ago, the genus Homo emerged with species like Homo habilis, considered one of the first toolmakers. This marked the beginning of more complex behavior and brain development. Homo erectus, appearing about 1.9 million years ago, was a significant evolutionary leap. It had a larger brain and body, used fire, and was the first hominin to migrate out of Africa into Asia and Europe. These early humans likely gave rise to other species, including Homo heidelbergensis and Homo neanderthalensis (Neanderthals).
Homo sapiens, our own species, evolved in Africa around 300,000 years ago. We coexisted for a time with other hominins, including Neanderthals in Europe and Denisovans in Asia, and even interbred with them, leaving traces of their DNA in modern human genomes. Our ancestors eventually spread across the globe, developing complex language, art, culture, and technology that set us apart from earlier humans.
This evolutionary journey from early bipedal primates to anatomically modern humans is a tale of adaptation, migration, and survival. While many hominin species went extinct, Homo sapiens thrived, largely due to our cognitive abilities, social cooperation, and technological innovations. Today, we are the only surviving species of the once-diverse human family tree.
